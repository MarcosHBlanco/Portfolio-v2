				<p className="mb-4 opacity-80">
					I never expected to swap dental drills for debugging tools, but life
					has a funny way of evolving—and I’m loving every minute of it! After
					years in healthcare (including a master’s in orthodontics), I channel
					my passion for precision and care into coding.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4 opacity-80">
					The qualities I honed—empathy, attention to detail, and clear
					communication—are just as vital in tech. As a Computer Science student
					at Langara College, I’m eager to bring my client-focused mindset and
					teamwork skills to collaborative projects.
				</p>
				<p className="opacity-80">
					Beyond code, I’m a lifelong learner: whether it’s exploring a new game
					engine or brainstorming an app feature, I thrive on challenges.
