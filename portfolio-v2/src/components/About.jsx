				<p className="mb-4 opacity-80">
					I never expected to swap dental drills for IDEs and programming
					languages, but life has a funny way of evolving--and I’m loving every
					minute of it! After years in healthcare in Brazil, as a Dentist
					(including a master’s in orthodontics), I decided to bring my passion
					for precision, efficiency and care into coding.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4 opacity-80">
					Certain qualities that I honed throughout my years in Healthcare, like
					empathy, attention to detail, clear communication, are just as usefull
					in tech as in Healthcare. As a Computer Science student at Langara
					College, I’m eager to bring my client-focused mindset and teamwork
					skills to collaborative projects.
				</p>
				<p className="opacity-80">
					I’m a curious soul--once I spot a question, I'll either find the
					answer or run out of coffee. I’m always looking to improve--whether
					it’s getting stronger at the gym, learning a tricky concept, or
					looking for ways to make my projects more interesting with Pokemons. I
					aim high and actually enjoy a good challenge--nothing feels better
					than finally getting that "AHA!!" moment.
