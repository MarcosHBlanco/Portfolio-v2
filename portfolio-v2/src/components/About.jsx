				I never expected to swap dental drills for debugging tools, but life has
				a funny way of evolving—and I’m loving every minute of it! After years
				in the healthcare field (including a master’s in orthodontics), I
				decided to channel my passion for precision and care into the tech
				realm. Now I’m a Computer Science student at Langara College, diving
				headfirst into software development.
			</p>
			<p className="m-3 ">
				Along the way, I’ve realized that many of the qualities I honed in
				healthcare—empathy, attention to detail, and the ability to communicate
				clearly—are just as vital in coding and collaborative tech projects. I’m
				eager to bring my client-focused mindset and teamwork skills to a
				Software Engineer Intern role, where I can continue to learn, grow, and
				help shape innovative ideas.{" "}

			<p className="m-3">
				Beyond the code, I’m a curious explorer who believes in lifelong
				learning. Whether it’s tinkering with a new game engine or brainstorming
				a breakthrough app feature, I’m always up for a challenge. I thrive in
				creative, forward-thinking environments, and I can’t wait to see where
				this journey takes me next!
